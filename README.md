Problem 1

Feel free to change the values for each rectangle or the length of the Rectangle array 
in the hard code I made in Problem1.java file. Compile that in terminal and it will
automatically use my Rectangle.java file to compare the rectangles by perimeter and 
return the largest one. I ended up not using my getWidth and getLength methods in my Rectangle class.

Problem 2

Similarly, feel free to alter values and length of the rectangles and array of rectangles
respectively to test my code. You can also change the values of the Rectangle you are 
specifically searching for; either in the array or not. Once compiled on terminal, it 
should print out the complete sorted array, the rectangle you are looking for, and its
location by index in the array. If it is not located in the array, it should return -1.

Problem 3

Again, manually input various values of n and k to test my code. Once compiled on Codio,
each of the fragments will run and print out their respective running times in nanoTime.
While the first two fragments are in the main method, I left the third fragment in a separate
method and called it in the main method instead.
